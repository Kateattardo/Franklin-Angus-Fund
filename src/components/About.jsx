          The Franklin Angus Fund was formed following the death of our
          founder's dog, Franklin. Franklin was saved from a rural Ohio pound in
          terrible physical shape and with debilitating anxiety. A former
          fighting dog, he had never lived in a home or known love. He became
          our founder's 13th foster dog and ultimately her only "foster fail".
          Franklin went on to become, well, magic. There was never a more
          loving, friendly, proud, dignified dog. Adopted in 2006, pit bull bias
          was at an all time high. But there wasn't a mind Franklin couldn't
          change. He turned strangers into friends, the skeptical into advocates
          and was known as the mayor of his Brooklyn neighborhood. He went
          everywhere: the parks, the bars, car rides, shopping malls, concerts,
          offices, beaches, subways, parties. People who met him went on to
          adopt pit bulls of their own, and people who met THEIR pit bulls
          adopted pit bulls of their own! His kindness, strength and pure heart
          had an immesurable ripple effect. Franklin died suddenly of cancer in
          2016, crushing the hearts of all who had met him. The year Franklin
          passed, The Franklin Fund was born. Here, thanks to the generosity of
          Franklin's friends, his spirit of kindness lives on. The Franklin
          Angus Fund provides care grants to pit bulls in rescues and shelters
          so that they may find loving homes, just like Franklin, and cause
          their own ripple.
